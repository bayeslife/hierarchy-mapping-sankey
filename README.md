# Presentation of connectivity between customer facing services and resource facing services via a sankey diagram from data exported from Enterprise Architect

## How

There separate diagrams were exported from Enterprise Architect as json files.
2 Hierarchy diagrams and 1 mapping diagram.

There diagrams were copied to the build directory as cfs, rfs and mapping.


# To produce a selfcontained html file you can run

```
selfcontained.sh
```

Which will combine the build .json and various other files into selfcontained.html
